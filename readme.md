Thank you for this opportunity. Here its the app that emulates a captcha game.

To deploy the application, all you need is a server to run it. There is not another installation need, is only vanilla language. I personally recommend a live server extension for visual studio for running the app.

I made a change in the app to make it more fun. I did the find for dogs or cat ramdon, because it felt strange to select what you want to find at the beginning. But is easy to make the change in any case.
